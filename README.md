# backrooms-rs
A single-user REST API for my budgeting and personal finance web-app.

This app provides two services:
* Budgeting: Recording your income and expenses, and tracking savings targets.
* Personal Finance: Keeping track of your net worth.

The application itself is a REST API, so all interactions will likely be through text commands.
A web-based front-end application will be built using this API as the back-end.

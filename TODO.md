# To Do

- Prefix API endpoints with '/api' to distinguish between pages and fragments.
- Update unit tests to parse HTML document tree for checking for the existence
  of nodes and attributes.
- Add logging middleware that logs incoming requests and outgoing responses.
  Passwords should be redacted.
